  "content": "<p>Sourdough bread is a beloved, naturally leavened bread that dates back thousands of years. Known for its slightly tangy flavor, chewy texture, and crisp crust, sourdough is unique because it's made without commercial yeast. Instead, it relies on a “starter,” a mixture of flour and water where wild yeast and lactic acid bacteria naturally ferment, causing the bread to rise.</p><p>The process of making sourdough involves mixing the starter with more flour and water, then allowing it to ferment. This slow fermentation not only enhances flavor but also makes the bread easier to digest, as the bacteria break down gluten and create beneficial acids. Once shaped and proofed, the dough is baked at a high temperature, giving it a beautiful crust and airy interior.</p><p>Sourdough has become popular among home bakers for its rich flavor and health benefits. Beyond traditional white or whole wheat, sourdough can be made with various flours, creating endless variations. Whether toasted, topped, or enjoyed on its own, sourdough bread is a versatile staple with a cherished place in the world of baking.</p>"
