Originally built as a fortress in the late 12th century, it was transformed into a royal palace before becoming a public museum during the French Revolution in 1793. The museum spans over 780,000 square feet and houses more than 380,000 objects, including iconic works such as the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.</p><p>The Louvre is divided into eight departments, featuring ancient civilizations, decorative arts, paintings, and sculptures from various periods. Its glass pyramid entrance, designed by architect I. M. Pei, has become a modern symbol of the museum and provides a striking contrast to the historic architecture of the palace.</p><p>Visitors can explore the museum's extensive galleries, which showcase masterpieces from Europe, the Middle East, and beyond. With its rich history, breathtaking art, and impressive architecture, the Louvre Museum remains a cultural treasure and a must-visit destination for art lovers around the globe.</p>",
